# Simpsons Quote App

This was a small app built to improve my working knowledge of Typescript. The user is able to enter a Simpson character name and then be able to see funny quotes from them provided by the Simpsons Quote API. 
If you want to give it a whirl, clone the repo, install the dependencies and run it on a localhost :) 
There might be a bug with the quote selector buttons - refreshing the page or finding a new character will fix this.

Shout-out and credit to @arooj-ilyas for helping me improve the app and get the useHooks working.
